            <h2>âœ¨ About Mrs. Mills: âœ¨</h2>
            <p>With a passion for inspiring young musicians, I have built a dynamic career as a dedicated music educator. I earned a Bachelor of Arts in Music Education from York College of Pennsylvania and a Master of Science in Education from Wilkes University. My teaching journey began at Big Spring School District, where I taught elementary music for grades K-5 and directed four elementary choral ensembles, cultivating foundational musical skills and a love for performance in my students.</p>
            <p>Currently, I teach at Fairfield Area Middle and High School, where I guide students through a wide variety of musical experiences. My teaching includes general music for grades 5-8, as well as high school electives such as Piano, Ukulele/Guitar, Music Technology, Vocal Music Studio, Music Appreciation, and Cultural Explorations in Music. Beyond the classroom, I direct choral ensembles for grades 5-12 and lead multiple extracurricular groups, including the High School Musical, Show Choir, Chamber Singers, and Select Chorus at the middle school level.</p>
            <p>Throughout my career, I have been committed to creating engaging, inclusive, and meaningful musical opportunities that empower students to develop both their artistic talents and their confidence.</p>
